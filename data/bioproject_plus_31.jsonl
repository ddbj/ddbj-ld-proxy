This study compares microbial communities of 10 co-hospitalized infants, five of which had a diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\nSurprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, a genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants that developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically-relevant time scales.","data type":"metagenome","organization":"Banfield Lab, University of California, Berkeley","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":["SAMN07977757","SAMN07977758","SAMN07977759","SAMN07977760","SAMN07977761","SAMN03295806","SAMN03295807","SAMN03295808","SAMN03295809","SAMN03295810","SAMN03295811","SAMN03295812","SAMN03295813","SAMN03295814","SAMN03295815","SAMN03295816","SAMN03295817","SAMN03295818","SAMN03295819","SAMN03295820","SAMN03295821","SAMN03295822","SAMN03295823","SAMN03295824","SAMN03295825","SAMN03295826","SAMN03295827","SAMN03295828","SAMN03295829","SAMN03295830","SAMN03295831","SAMN03295832","SAMN03295833","SAMN03295834","SAMN03295835","SAMN03295836","SAMN03295837","SAMN03295838","SAMN03295839","SAMN03295840","SAMN03295841","SAMN03295842","SAMN03295843","SAMN03295844","SAMN03295845","SAMN03295846","SAMN03295847","SAMN03295848","SAMN03295849","SAMN03295850","SAMN03295851","SAMN03295852","SAMN03295853","SAMN03295854","SAMN03295855","SAMN03295856","SAMN03295857","SAMN03295858","SAMN03295859","SAMN03295860"],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2015-01-27","dateModified":"2015-01-27","_annotation":{"sample_count":2510,"sample_organism":["Thomasclavelia ramosa","Bacillus sp.

To dissect interactions between the gut microbiota, diet and genetic background, we utilized three inbred strains of mice, which differ in development of obesity and metabolic syndrome, plus three derivative lines generated by breeding these strains in a common environment. Analysis of metabolic parameters and gut microbiota in the inbred strains and their environmentally normalized derivatives revealed strong interactions between the microbiota, diet, environmental history and metabolic phenotypes. Some phenotypes could be transferred to germ-free recipient animals by fecal transplant. Strong strain-dependent and strain-independent correlations were found between specific microbes and metabolic phenotypes. Environmental reprogramming of the microbiota resulted in one obesity-prone strain becoming obesity-resistant. Thus, in mice, development of obesity/metabolic syndrome is the result of strong interactions between the gut microbiota, host genetics and diet. In permissive genetic backgrounds, environmental reprograming of the microbiota can ameliorate development of metabolic syndrome.","data type":"Other","organization":"Center for Gut Microbiome and Nutrition Research, Washington University School of Medicine","publication":[{"id":"26299453","Title":"Interactions between Gut Microbiota, Host Genetics and Diet Modulate the Predisposition to Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2015-08-21","dateModified":"2015-08-21","datePublished":"2015-08-20T00:00:00Z","_annotation":{"sample_count":347,"sample_organism":["mouse gut metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["410661"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["USA"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":[null,null],"sample_temperature_range":[null,null]}}

This study aimed to characterize the microbiota across multiple proximal GI sites over time in healthy individuals./ppResults: Healthy, fasted volunteers (N=8; 10 admissions total) were orally intubated with a four-lumen catheter with multiple aspiration ports, allowing sampling of stomach, duodenal, and multiple jejunal sites. Fluid was sampled hourly (7 hours) to measure mesalamine (administered at t=0), pH, and 16S rRNA gene-based microbial composition. We observed a predominance of Firmicutes across proximal GI sites, with significant variation compared to stool. The microbiota was more similar within patients over time than across; the stomach and duodenal microbiota displayed highest intra-individual variability compared to jejunal sites, which were more stable across time. In the duodenum, but not the stomach, we observed significant fluctuations in microbial composition with changes in pH; linear mixed models identified positive correlations with multiple Streptococcus OTUs and negative correlations with multiple Prevotella and Pasteurellaceae (Proteobacteria) OTUs. Mesalamine concentration was significantly correlated with very few OTUs in the duodenum and stomach./ppConclusion: Compared to the stool microbiota, the microbiota in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum was distinct. Short-term fluctuations in the duodenal microbiota correlated with changes in pH compared to the jejunum or stomach.","data type":"raw sequence reads","organization":"University of Michigan","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2018-10-09","dateModified":"2018-10-09","_annotation":{"sample_count":184,"sample_organism":["human gut metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["408170"],"sample_host_organism":["Homo sapiens"],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["USA:Michigan"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":["1.02","NA"],"sample_temperature_range":[null,null]}}

The biology of these malignancies is not fully elucidated, but some microbes have been hypothesized to play roles in malignant T cell transformation in CTCL. Whether the skin microbiome differs between healthy adults and CTCL patients and whether disease stage affects skin microbial communities are not fully understood. To address these questions, we used a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach to investigate microbial communities at pre-determined, matched skin sites in six CTCL patients (stage IA to IVA1) and ten age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. DNA was isolated from skin swab samples, and libraries were created for metagenomic sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. We observed notable shifts in skin bacterial abundances between CTCL patients and healthy volunteers with increasing trends in the mean relative abundances of Corynebacterium species and decreasing trends in Cutibacterium species on CTCL patient skin.","data type":"genome sequencing","organization":"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases","publication":[{"id":"33212154","Title":"Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Skin Microbiome Is Characterized by Shifts in Certain Commensal Bacteria but not Viruses when Compared with Healthy Controls."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2020-06-29","dateModified":"2020-06-29","_annotation":{"sample_count":67,"sample_organism":["human skin metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["539655"],"sample_host_organism":["Homo sapiens"],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["USA"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":[null,null],"sample_temperature_range":[null,null]}}
